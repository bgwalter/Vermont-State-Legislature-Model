Vermont-State-Legislature-Model
===============================

## About

An Agent Based Model of a senate committee in the Vermont State Legislature.

Advanced Workshop in CAPA - Fall 2014 to Spring 2015

**Rationale:**

Committee chairs in the Vermont State Legislature have little formal power, yet they seem to wield a disproportionate amount of influence over committee membersâ€™ voting. This raises questions about how democratic the committees actually are in practice and what can be done to create a better structure. Lack of rigorous methods to investigate the effects of the role of committee Chair furthers this being the case, and creating these methods could identify opportunities for procedural reform.

**Mission:**

By modeling observational data captured from the legislature itself, we can begin to track the 'flow' of influence throughout the committee and quantify who is influencing who in their voting patterns and by how much. Once a reasonably accurate model is created, we can then start to change certain variables in a search for how to produce more democratic practices, if that turns out to be the most desirable outcome.
