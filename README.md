# The Role and Flow of Influence in the Vermont State Legislature

## About

An Agent Based Model for a senate committee in the Vermont State Legislature.

Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/vpascow/Vermont-State-Legislature-Model/wiki) for much more information about this project!

### Rationale

Committee chairs in the Vermont State Legislature have little formal power, yet they seem to wield a
disproportionate amount of influence over committee membersâ€™ voting. This raises questions about
how democratic the committees actually are in practice and what can be done to create a better
structure. Lack of rigorous methods to investigate the effects of the role of committee Chair furthers
this being the case, and creating these methods could identify opportunities for procedural reform.

### Mission

By modeling observational data captured from the legislature itself, we can begin to track the 'flow'
of influence throughout the committee and quantify who is influencing who in their voting patterns
and by how much. Once a reasonably accurate model is created, we can then start to change certain
variables in a search for how to produce more democratic practices, if that turns out to be the most
desirable outcome.
